## 💡 MongoDB's Guiding Principle (Simple Explanation)

> ### **"Data that is accessed together should be stored together."**

**What does this mean?**

Think about viewing an order on a website:
- You see: Order date, customer name, items, total price
- You DON'T see: Customer's email, phone, or current product inventory

**MongoDB's approach:** Store what you see together in one document!

### 📊 Visual Example

**Traditional Database (SQL):**
```
orders table    →  JOIN  →  order_items table  →  JOIN  →  products table
customers table →  JOIN  →  orders table
```
Result: Multiple queries, slow performance

**MongoDB (This Demo):**
```json
{
  "orderId": "123",
  "customerName": "John Doe",        ← Stored together!
  "items": [                         ← Stored together!
    {
      "name": "Laptop",              ← Stored together!
      "price": 1299.99,
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ],
  "total": 1299.99
}
```
Result: One query, fast performance! 🚀

## 🎓 Three Simple Patterns (For Beginners)

### 1. **Embedding** = Store Everything Together
- **When?** Data is ALWAYS accessed together
- **Example:** Order items are always shown with the order
- **Benefit:** One query gets everything!

### 2. **Subset Pattern** = Store Some Data Together
- **When?** You FREQUENTLY need some fields, but not all
- **Example:** You often need customer name, but rarely need email/phone
- **Benefit:** Fast queries most of the time!

### 3. **Reference** = Store Link Only
- **When?** You RARELY need the related data
- **Example:** Full customer profile is only needed occasionally
- **Benefit:** Saves space, single source of truth!

---

## 🔍 How This Demo Uses These Patterns

### Pattern 1: Embedding (OrderItems in Orders)
```java
private List<OrderItem> items;  // Items stored INSIDE the order
```
**Why?** You ALWAYS need items when viewing an order ✅

### Pattern 2: Subset (Customer Name in Orders)
```java
private String customerId;      // Link to full customer data
private String customerName;    // Copy for quick display
```
**Why?** You FREQUENTLY need name, RARELY need email/phone ✅

### Pattern 3: Reference (Customer ID)
```java
private String customerId;      // Link to get full customer when needed
```
**Why?** Full customer data is OCCASIONALLY needed ✅

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Java 21+**
- **Maven 3.6+**
- **MongoDB 8** (running locally on port 27017)

### Start MongoDB

```bash
# Using Docker (recommended for demo)

**See [WEB_INTERFACE_GUIDE.md](WEB_INTERFACE_GUIDE.md) for a complete walkthrough.**

---

### Option 2: curl Commands (Traditional)

If you prefer command-line testing, here are the curl commands:

#### 1. Create a Customer

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/customers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "phone": "+1-555-0123"
  }'
```

**Note:** Save the customer `id` from the response - you'll need it for creating orders.

### 2. Create Products

```bash
# Create Product 1: Laptop
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Laptop Pro 15",
    "description": "High-performance 15.6-inch laptop designed for professionals and power users. Features Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, and 512GB SSD.",
    "price": 1299.99,
    "category": "Electronics",
    "inventory": 50
  }'

# Create Product 2: Wireless Mouse
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Wireless Mouse",
    "description": "Ergonomic wireless mouse with precision tracking and long battery life. Perfect for productivity and gaming.",
    "price": 29.99,
    "category": "Accessories",
    "inventory": 200
  }'

# Create Product 3: USB-C Cable
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "USB-C Cable 2m",
    "description": "Durable 2-meter USB-C cable supporting fast charging and data transfer up to 480Mbps. Universal compatibility.",
    "price": 15.99,
    "category": "Accessories",
    "inventory": 500
  }'
```

### 3. Get All Products

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/products | jq
```

### 4. Create an Order (with Inventory Validation) 🆕

**Note:** Replace `<customer-id>`, `<product-id-1>`, and `<product-id-2>` with actual IDs from the customer and products you created.

**This operation now uses MongoDB ACID transactions to:**
- ✅ Validate inventory availability
- ✅ Create the order
- ✅ Decrement product inventory
- ✅ Rollback everything if any step fails

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "<customer-id>",
    "customerName": "John Doe",
    "items": [
      {
        "productId": "<product-id-1>",
        "name": "Laptop Pro 15",
        "price": 1299.99,
        "quantity": 1
      },
      {
        "productId": "<product-id-2>",
        "name": "Wireless Mouse",
        "price": 29.99,
        "quantity": 2
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "_id": "order123",
  "customerId": "cust456",
  "customerName": "John Doe",
  "items": [...],
  "total": 1359.97
}
```

**Insufficient Inventory Response (HTTP 400):**
```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient inventory for product 'Laptop Pro 15'. Available: 0, Requested: 1"
}
```

### 5. Verify Inventory Was Decremented 🆕

```bash
# Check the product inventory after order creation
curl http://localhost:8080/products/<product-id-1> | jq

# You'll see inventory decreased by the quantity ordered!
```

### 6. Test Insufficient Inventory (Transaction Rollback) 🆕

```bash
# Try to order more than available (should fail gracefully)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "<customer-id>",
    "customerName": "Jane Smith",
    "items": [
      {
        "productId": "<product-id-1>",
        "name": "Laptop Pro 15",
        "price": 1299.99,
        "quantity": 1000
      }
    ]
  }'

# Returns HTTP 400 with clear error message
# No order created, inventory unchanged!
```

### 7. Get All Orders

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/orders | jq
```

## 💡 "Data Accessed Together, Stored Together" - In Action

### Real-World Query Analysis

Let's analyze how data is actually accessed in an e-commerce system:

#### Common Query Patterns:

1. **"Show order details"** (90% of queries)
   - Need: Order date, customer name, items, total
   - Don't need: Customer email, phone, address
   - Don't need: Current product inventory

2. **"List all orders"** (80% of queries)
   - Need: Order ID, customer name, date, total
   - Don't need: Full customer profile
   - Don't need: Current product details

3. **"Get customer profile"** (10% of queries)
   - Need: Full customer data (name, email, phone, address)
   - Don't need: Order details

4. **"Update product inventory"** (5% of queries)
   - Need: Current product data
   - Don't need: Historical order data

### How This Demo Applies the Principle:

#### ✅ OrderItems EMBEDDED in Order
**Why?** Order items are ALWAYS accessed with the order.

```json
{
  "_id": "order123",
  "items": [                    // ← EMBEDDED (accessed together)
    {
      "productId": "prod456",
      "name": "Laptop",
      "price": 1299.99,
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:** One query retrieves complete order. No joins!

#### ✅ Customer Name STORED in Order (Subset Pattern)
**Why?** Customer name is FREQUENTLY accessed with order, but full customer data is not.

```json
{
  "_id": "order123",
  "customerId": "cust789",      // ← Reference (for full data when needed)
  "customerName": "John Doe"    // ← Subset (accessed together with order)
}
```

**Result:** 90% of queries need no lookup. 10% can still get full customer data.

#### ✅ Product Details STORED in OrderItem (Subset Pattern)
**Why?** Product name/price at order time is ALWAYS accessed with order items.

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "productId": "prod456",   // ← Reference (for current product data)
      "name": "Laptop Pro 15",  // ← Subset (historical snapshot)
      "price": 1299.99          // ← Subset (price at order time)
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:** Order history queries are instant. Current product data still accessible.

## 💡 Why Embed OrderItems in MongoDB?

### The Power of Embedded Documents

In this demo, `OrderItem` objects are **embedded** directly within the `Order` document rather than being stored in a separate collection. This is a key MongoDB design pattern that exemplifies **"data accessed together, stored together"**.

### Benefits of Embedding:

1. **Single Query Performance**
   - Retrieve an order with all its items in ONE database query
   - No joins required (unlike relational databases)
   - Faster read performance for order details

2. **Atomic Operations**
   - The entire order (including all items) is updated atomically
   - No risk of partial updates or inconsistent state
   - Transactional integrity at the document level

3. **Data Locality**
   - Related data is stored together on disk
   - Better cache utilization
   - Reduced I/O operations

4. **Natural Data Model**
   - Matches how we think about orders in the real world
   - An order "contains" items - this is reflected in the data structure
   - JSON structure mirrors the domain model

### When to Embed vs. Reference?

**Embed when:**
- Data is accessed together (like orders and their items)
- One-to-few relationships (an order has a limited number of items)
- Data doesn't change independently (order items are fixed once ordered)

**Reference when:**
- Data is accessed independently
- One-to-many or many-to-many relationships with large cardinality
- Data changes frequently and independently

### Example: Why We Reference Products and Customers

Notice that:
- `Order` contains a `customerId` field that **references** the Customer collection
- `OrderItem` contains a `productId` field that **references** the Product collection

This is because:
- Customer information (email, phone) changes independently
- Product information (price, inventory) changes independently
- Customers and products are shared across many orders
- We want a single source of truth for customer and product data

This demonstrates a **hybrid approach**:
- **Embedding** order items for performance (accessed together)
- **Referencing** customers and products for data integrity (shared data)

### The Subset Pattern: Storing Customer ID and Name

Notice that `Order` stores **both** `customerId` (reference) and `customerName` (subset of customer data).

**This is the MongoDB "Subset Pattern" - a best practice for optimizing read performance:**

**What is the Subset Pattern?**
- Store a **reference** to the full document (customerId)
- Store a **subset** of frequently accessed fields (customerName)
- Keep the full document in its own collection for complete data

**Benefits:**
1. **Query Performance** - Display order lists without joining to customers collection
2. **Historical Accuracy** - Preserves customer name at time of order
3. **Reduced Complexity** - Common queries like "show all orders" don't need lookups
4. **Better UX** - Order reports can be generated instantly
5. **Flexibility** - Can still access full customer data when needed via customerId

**Trade-off:**
- Data duplication (customer name in both collections)
- If customer changes name, old orders keep the old name (usually desired for historical accuracy!)

**When to use the Subset Pattern:**
- Data is read frequently with the parent document
- Only a few fields from the referenced document are needed most of the time
- Read performance is more critical than write complexity
- You still need access to the full referenced document occasionally

**Pattern in this demo:**
- `customerId` → reference for data integrity and full customer lookups
- `customerName` → subset for display and performance
- Similarly, `OrderItem` uses the Subset Pattern with `productId` + `name`/`price` (snapshot at order time)

**Example Query Comparison:**

*Without Subset Pattern (requires lookup):*
```javascript
// Get orders
const orders = db.orders.find()
// For each order, lookup customer
orders.forEach(order => {
  const customer = db.customers.findOne({_id: order.customerId})
  console.log(customer.name)
})
```

*With Subset Pattern (no lookup needed):*
```javascript
// Get orders with customer name already included
db.orders.find().forEach(order => {
  console.log(order.customerName)  // Already available!
})
```

## 🎓 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Document-Oriented Storage
MongoDB stores data as JSON-like documents (BSON), making it natural to work with Java objects.

### 2. Spring Data MongoDB
- `@Document` annotation maps Java classes to MongoDB collections
- `@Id` annotation marks the primary key field
- `MongoRepository` provides built-in CRUD operations

### 3. Automatic Mapping
Spring Data MongoDB automatically converts:
- Java objects → BSON documents (when saving)
- BSON documents → Java objects (when retrieving)

### 4. Business Logic in Controllers
The `OrderController` demonstrates:
- Automatic `orderDate` assignment
- Total calculation from embedded items
- Clean separation of concerns
